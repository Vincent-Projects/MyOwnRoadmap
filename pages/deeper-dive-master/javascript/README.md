# Javascript

Here i'll cover javascript, one of my ( if not the ) favourite language. I'll try to take its parts as programming language without focusing on the web part.

-   Syntax
-   Operators
-   First Class Meaning
-   Types
-   Date
-   Math
-   Array
-   Object
-   Scope
-   Closures
-   Strict Mode
