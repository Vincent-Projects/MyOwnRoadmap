<details><summary>Attribute</summary>

Each element has its own attribute and some are common to all. I'll put the attribute of an element in details of its tags above. Here are some for reference.

| --------- | ----------- | ------- |
| class     |             |         |
| id        |             |         |
| href      |             |         |
| src       |             |         |
| alt       |             |         |
| style     |             |         |
| data-\*   |             |         |
| type      |             |         |
| name      |             |         |
