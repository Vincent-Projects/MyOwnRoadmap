# Deeper Dive Into The Language I Master

In this section i'll talk about the languages i master the most to give more details than the previous section where i talk briefly about languages i learned. As i'm still a beginner there is only one language i consider myself to master and it is Javascript. When i say, i master i mean that i'm more confident using this language over the others.

**Here what i'll cover**

-   Javascript
-   Ecmascript 2015+ ( ES6 )
