# Typescript

Here i'll put everything i'll learn about typescript. I'll use [typescriptlang](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html) as a resource for my learning. They provide a [handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/assets/typescript-handbook.pdf) which seem to be great for that learning.
